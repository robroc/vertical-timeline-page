#### A simple HTML page for adding a vertical timeline

This uses the awesome [vertical timeline by MinnPost](https://github.com/MinnPost/jquery-vertical-timeline), which is based on [this one by Balance Media](https://github.com/balancemedia/Timeline).

Includes media queries to hide the control buttons when page is less than 565px. This prevents the buttons from stacking on top of each other.

Just plug in the spreadsheet ID and sheet name in the script at the bottom.
